![Main page](image.png "FF Home Page")

Friend Finder is a basic match making service web app, that finds a match based on answer value similarity. A server is generated with Node-express, and routes to the relevent resources are created. Relevent paths are made with the PATH module.

Users can take the survey, and thier match gets diplayed via a modal popup. User data then gets added to the mix for further potential matches!
